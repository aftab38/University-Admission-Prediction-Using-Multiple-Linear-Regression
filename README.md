# University Admission Prediction Using Multiple Linear Regression
Motivation behind this project is to train a suitable model for the prediction of admission of a student in a university.
Performed feature scaling then splitted the whole data into training & testing set.
Trained and evaluated Multiple Linear Regression Model, Decision Tree Model, Random Forest Model & Artificial Neural Network.
Calculated Regression Model KPIs.
